// Very good at representing real world data
// Graphs are made up of vertices and edges
// Set of values that are related in a pair-wise fashion
// Each item is a vertex (node) and they connect 
// to other vertices via edges (which represent a relationshit)

// Examples:
// --> Social Networks
// --> Maps
// --> Routing Algorithms
// --> Visual Hierarchy
// --> Google Maps to find shortest path
//

// Trees are a type of Graphs


// Types of Graphs:
// --> Directed vs Undirected:
//     --> Directed: One way street
//     --> Undirected: Two way street
// --> Weighted vs Unweighted:
//     --> Weighted: Edges have values
//     --> Unweighted: Edges do not have values
// --> Cyclic vs Acyclic:
//     --> Cyclic: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex
//     --> Acyclic: A graph without cycles
