// Data strcuture that has hierarchical order
// It's non linear
// Has a root node at the top and has child nodes connected by edges
// Trees are built in such a way that there are no cycles or loops (There are a few exceptions)
// There's a unique path from the root node to any other node
// Used in:
// --> File System;
// --> DOM is a tree;
// --> Facebook comments;
// --> File System;
// --> Abstract Syntax Tree: How code is run!
// The nodes in Trees can contain any type of data
// Linked List is a type of Tree(Linear --> only a single path)
// A node can only point to a child!
// Always an entry point which is the root!
// There are multiple types of trees
