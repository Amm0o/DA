// Why is it important to study sorting algorithms?
// When inputs are large and unsorted, it is important to know which sorting algorithm to use.
// Most times we either sort data or pre process the data.


// When should I use each sorting algorithm?
// --> Insertion sort: When the list is almost sorted or already sorted AND input is small
// --> Bubble Sort: Don't use it xD
// --> Selection Sort : Don't use it xD
// --> Merge Sort: When you need a stable sort (order of equal elements is preserved)
// --> Quick Sort: When you need an in-place sort (no extra memory is needed) :: Vary bad worst case O(n^2)
